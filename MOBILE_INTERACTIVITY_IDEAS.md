Based on 2024 mobile UX research and best practices, here are interactive features we can implement:

## 1. **Touch-Interactive Food Icons**
- Tap food icons to see them animate/scale up
- Add ripple effect on tap
- Show brief description tooltip on long press
- Icons bounce/react when tapped

## 2. **Swipe Gestures**
- Swipe left/right on "Takumi" text to manually cycle languages
- Swipe up to reveal more content or scroll down
- Swipe down to refresh (if needed)

## 3. **Parallax Scroll Effects**
- Food icons move at different speeds when scrolling
- Background elements create depth
- Text fades in/out on scroll

## 4. **Pull-to-Expand Animation**
- Pull down on hero to reveal special offer or menu preview
- Elastic bounce effect
- Smooth spring animation

## 5. **Interactive Floating Icons**
- Tap floating icons to make them spin/explode
- Double-tap to add to favorites (if applicable)
- Long press for quick menu category access

## 6. **Micro-Interactions**
- Button press animations with visual feedback
- Text typing effect for "Takumi"
- Particle effects on button clicks
- Haptic-like visual feedback (vibration simulation)

## 7. **Gesture-Based Navigation**
- Swipe from edges to navigate
- Pinch to zoom on food images
- Two-finger tap for quick actions

## 8. **Progressive Disclosure**

- Floating action button for ordering

## Implementation Priority:
1. **High Priority**: Touch-interactive icons, Swipe gestures for text, Micro-interactions on buttons
2. **Medium Priority**: Parallax effects, Pull-to-expand, Interactive floating icons
3. **Nice to Have**: Gesture navigation, Progressive disclosure, Interactive background
